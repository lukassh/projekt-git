			<p>Last Christmas

				But the very next day 
				You gave it away 
				This year 
				To save me from tears 
				I'll give it to someone special

				Last Christmas 
				I gave you my heart 
				But the very next day 
				You gave it away (you gave it away)
				This year 
				To save me from tears 
				I'll give it to someone special (special)
			</p>

			<p>
				Once bitten and twice shy 
				I keep my distance 
				But you still catch my eye 
				Tell me baby 
				Do you recognize me? 
				Well 
				It's been a year 
				It doesn't surprise me
